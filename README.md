A modified version of the [Obsidian Relative Line Numbers](https://github.com/nadavspi/obsidian-relative-line-numbers) plugin that **combines absolute and relative line numbers in a single column** for cleaner display.

**Key change**:  
Merged the original dual-column layout (absolute/relative numbers) into one unified column while preserving both numbering systems.

**Requirement**:  
Enable "Show line number" in Obsidian's Editor settings.
